### power-precision-samplesize / pss-comparison-based

- Title: Power and Sample Size Calculations based on Comparing Expectations
- Description: Power and sample size justification for common requests with vague research hypotheses involving comparisons (e.g., one-sample, two-sample) and possible multiple testing (i.e., multiplicity).
